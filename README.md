# Key Clicker Amplifier

A simple application designed to amplify key presses. This app allows you to repeat a specified key multiple times.

I made this app cause a game called "Supermarket Together" forced me to roll up my mouse wheel and my hand literally starting to feel pain XD.

I released the executeable version but only with the repeation invertal of 0.05 that you can download and immedietly use.
